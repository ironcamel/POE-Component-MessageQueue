=head1 NAME

POE::Component::MessageQueue::Storage::Generic -- Wraps storage engines that aren't asynchronous via L<POE::Component::Generic> so they can be used.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use POE;
  use POE::Component::MessageQueue;
  use POE::Component::MessageQueue::Storage::Generic;
  use POE::Component::MessageQueue::Storage::Generic::DBI;
  use strict;

  # For mysql:

  my $DB_USERNAME = 'perl_mq';
  my $DB_PASSWORD = 'perl_mq';
  my $DB_OPTIONS  = undef;

  POE::Component::MessageQueue->new({
    storage => POE::Component::MessageQueue::Storage::Generic->new({
      package => 'POE::Component::MessageQueue::Storage::DBI',
      options => [

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Wraps storage engines that aren't asynchronous via L<POE::Component::Generic> so they can be used.

Using this module is by far the easiest way to write custom storage engines because you don't have to worry about making your operations asynchronous.  This approach isn't without its down-sides, but on the whole, the simplicity is worth it.

There is only one package currently provided designed to work with this module: L<POE::Component::MessageQueue::Storage::Generic::DBI>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 2

=item package_name

The name of the package to wrap.  Required.

=item options

An arrayref of the options to be passed to the supplied package's constructor.
