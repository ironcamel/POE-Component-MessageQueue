=head1 NAME

POE::Component::MessageQueue::Storage::Remote -- Access a remote storage
engine via a TCP socket

=head1 DESCRIPTION

With this module, you can talk to a storage engine running under
L<POE::Component::MessageQueue::Storage::Remote::Server> transparently.  You
can treat this like a normal local store once it's set up, and it can
optionally failover to other stores.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR PARAMETERS

=over 2

=item servers

An arrayref of hashrefs of the form C<< {host => 'hostname, port => port} >>.
Remote will try these servers in a round robin fashion whenever it fails to
connect or gets disconnected.  Passing in just one server is an effective way
to say "keep connecting to this server until it's up and reconnect to it if
you get disconnected."
