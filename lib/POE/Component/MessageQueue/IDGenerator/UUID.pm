=head1 NAME

POE::Component::MessageQueue::IDGenerator::UUID - UUID generator.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a concrete implementation of the Generator interface for creating
message IDs.  It uses standards compliant UUIDs, which according to Data::UUID
are guaranteed to be unique until 3500 C.E., though I'm not sure how it knows
that.
