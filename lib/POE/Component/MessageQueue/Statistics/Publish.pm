=head1 NAME

POE::Component::MessageQueue::Statistics::Publish - Base Statistics Publish Class

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new(%args)

Creates a new instance. You must pass in an instance of POE::Component::MessageQueue::Statistics, and an output destination

	# initialized elsewhere
	my $stats   = POE::Component::MessageQueue::Statistics->new;

	my $publish = POE::Component::MessageQueue::Statistics::Publish::YAML->new(
		output => \*STDERR,
		statistics => $stats,
		interval => 10, # dump every 10 seconds
	);

=head2 publish()

Publishes the current state of the statistics. This is actually a dispatcher
that dispatches to the appropriate method calls (described below) that are
specific to a particular output type.

Your subclass should implement the appropriate methods (output types) that
you want to support.

=head2 publish_file($filename)

Receives a filename to dump the statistics.

=head2 publish_handle($handle)

Receives a handle to dump the statistics.

=head2 publish_code($code)

Receives a subroutine reference. Your code should simply pass the result
output to $code and execute it:

	sub publish_code
	{
		my ($self, $code) = @_;
		my $output = ....; # generate output here
		$code->( $output );
	}
